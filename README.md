# redox_benchmark
A repo for benchmark test of the redox potential of molecules

## Prerequisites
- **CUDA 12.x**: Required for gpu4pyscf GPU acceleration
- **CREST**: Required for conformational sampling (See [CREST](https://crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs/))
- **Python**: ≥ 3.9
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

## Install
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AM3GroupHub/redox_benchmark.git
cd redox_benchmark
```
Basic Installation
```shell
pip install -e .
```
Install MACE (for MACE-OMol-0)
```shell
pip install -e .[mace]
```
Install FairChem (for UMA)
```shell
pip install -e .[fairchem]
```
If your CUDA version is not 12, you can manually install [GPU4PySCF](https://github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf) CUDA 11 or 13 version.


## Usage
```bash
calc_redox --config config.yaml
```
